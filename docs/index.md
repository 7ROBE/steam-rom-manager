# Features

## Rich documentation

Everything you need to know is right there under your nose! It even has a cheeky FAQ for slow learners or lazy people.

        Your browser does not support the video tag.

## Choose your image

You can choose the image you like!

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <video style="width: 100%; max-width: 1600px; height: auto;" autoplay loop>
        <source src="./videos/choose-image.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

## Verbose information about what your parser is doing

Parser not working or is working not as you intended it to? Test it to see what's what!

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <video style="width: 100%; max-width: 1600px; height: auto;" autoplay loop>
        <source src="./videos/parser-test.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</p>

## Fuzzy (natural) title matching

Can't seem to find images for your title, but they are certainly on supported websites? Could it be due to some missing or mistypes characters in your title? Fuzzy matching to the rescue! It will match closest title to the list of titles downloaded from [SteamGridDB](http://www.steamgriddb.com/).

        <source src="./videos/fuzzy-matching.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.

## Other features

* Multiplatform - runs on Windows and Linux! Should run on Mac OS too, but you'll need to build it from source yourself.
* Multiple image providers - fully supports image downloads from **SteamGridDB**, **retrogaming.cloud** and partially from **ConsoleGrid**.
* Local images - you can set parser up to user your own local images.
