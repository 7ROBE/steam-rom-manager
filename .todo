# Notes
To update all the config presets at once I use
1) in WSL:
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/\"defaultLogoImage\"\:\ \"\"\,/\"defaultLogoI
mage"\:\ \"\"\,\n\"defaultIcon\"\:\ \"\"\,/g' {} \;
2) in VIM:
:args . | argdo execute "normal gg=G" | update


That was the old method!

New method:


1) Make a modifier in `src/renderer/modifiers/config-presets.modifier.ts` to make the desired change to the preset files
2) Add the current app version and current app commit (or any commit before presets change) to `files/presetsHashes.json`
3) Run `npm run update-files` and ensure the new presets validate (validation comes from the user-configuration schema)
4) Commit changes and `git push`
