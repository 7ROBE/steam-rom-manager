# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.1.4 - 2017-05-02
### Fixed
* `shortcuts.vdf` should now have recurring titles removed as intended. If you had titles disappear, it was because Steam changed `AppName` property to `appname`. That resulted in too many titles and Steam got confused. Simply re-adding all titles via SRM should fix it as it will delete duplicates.

## 1.1.3 - 2017-05-01
### Added
* Greedy search option which will search for images using both `${title}` and `${fuzzyTitle}`

### Fixed
* Added a temporary fix, which should prevent `shortcuts.vdf` corruption

## 1.1.2 - 2017-05-01
### Added
* Additional one time backups will be made with extension `.firstbackup`

### Changed
* Glob-regex now joins capture pairs. See [here](https://regex101.com/r/xasqq9/2) how it can be used

### Fixed
* Alert component now times out as intended (previously it would just stay there until user clicked it or it received a new message to display)
