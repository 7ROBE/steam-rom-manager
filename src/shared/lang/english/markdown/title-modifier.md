# Title modifier

Default value is `${title}`{.noWrap}. This setting can be used to prepend or append desired characters to a title which will be added to Steam. For example, given that `${title}`{.noWrap} is `Zelda 2`, you can add ` (1.7.5)` to it by setting value to:
```
${title} (1.7.5)
```
This setting influences Steam's APP ID.
