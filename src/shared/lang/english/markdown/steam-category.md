# Steam category (optional)

Also known as "tags", can be used to group apps in Steam. In order to set Steam category, the following syntax must be used:
```
${...}
```
For example, this is how you specify categories for "WII" and "GBA" (paired with "ROMS") category:
```
${WII}
```
```
${GBA}${ROMS}
```
This how "WII" category will look like in Steam:
