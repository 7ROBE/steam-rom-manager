# Image pool `[supports variables]`{.noWrap}

Default value is `${fuzzyTitle}`{.noWrap}. This setting is used to allow different apps share the same images -- same "image pool", or allow unique image pool per app.
To use unique image pool per app it is recommended to set image pool to `${appId}`{.noWrap} which is always unique per Steam directory.
