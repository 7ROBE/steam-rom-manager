# Executable (optional)

Path to emulator's executable.

## Why optional?

In some cases you might want to run game from a some kind batch file which will also automatically run the emulator itself. If that is the case, then providing executable is unnecessary.

### So, how do I add files to Steam without default executable?

All files retrieved by a parser will be treated as executables instead.
