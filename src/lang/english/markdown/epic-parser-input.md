# Manifests Directory Override

Most users won't use this, as they use the standard Epic Games Store installation where the game manifests will be located in, for example on Windows, `C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests`. If, however, for some reason your game manifests directory is located in a non-typical location (usually because you use the epic games store alternate [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary)) then you can specify the correct manifests directory here.
