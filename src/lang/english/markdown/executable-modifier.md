# Executable modifier `[supports variables]`{.noWrap}

Default value is `"${exePath}"`{.noWrap}. This setting can be used to prepend or append desired characters to an executable which will be added to Steam (`Target` property). For example, given that `${exePath}`{.noWrap} is `C:\RetroArch\retroarch.exe`, you can add `"cmd" /k start /min` to it by setting value to:
```
"cmd" /k start /min "${exePath}"
```
You can use any other variable to construct the final executable.

This setting influences Steam's APP ID.
