# Epic Games Parser

This parser imports games from the `Epic Games Store` so that artwork can be chosen for them and they can be added into Steam. 

If it doesn't work it is because Epic has altered the structure of their game manifests, in this case please let the developers of SRM know and we will resolve the issue.

## Compatibility
This parser is currently functional on `Windows` and `Mac OS` systems only. On `Mac OS` it is not possible to launch from the Epic Store, so that toggle should remain disabled.
