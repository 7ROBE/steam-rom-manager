# Community Presets
These are parser configurations that have been created by the SRM community and just need to be altered slightly with a few system specific parameters in order to work (usually just `ROMs Directory` and `Executable` need to be specified).

## Generic Parser
The Generic Parser (the first preset) works for a wide variety of emulators that don't need specific commandline arguments in order to work, for example:
* Yuzu
* Citra
* Xenia (add `--fullscreen` in `Command Line Arguments` if desired)
