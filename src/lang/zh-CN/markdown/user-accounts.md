# User accounts (Required)

This field is used to limit SRM's effects to specific user accounts. It can be set to `Global` or over ridden per parser.

## 警告

If you have `Don't save account credentials on this computer` set in Steam, then there is no way for SRM to know your `Steam Username` and `Choose Accounts` will only be able to pull your `Steam IDs`. 如果您这里使用`Steam用户名`, 选择 `Steam > Settings > Settings` 并禁用 `不要在这台计算机上保存账户凭据`, 然后重启Steam和SRM.
