# Steam parser

This parser imports steam games into SRM. It does not add shortcuts, but it allows you to set the artwork for your steam games. By default the parser will get games from all user accounts in the steam directory specified &mdash; if you would prefer to only get the games for a subset of the accounts then specify them in the `User accounts` field.
